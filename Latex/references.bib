abstract = "New algorithms for deciding whether a (propositional) Horn formula is satisfiable are presented. If the Horn formula A contains K distinct propositional letters and if it is assumed that they are exactly P1,…, PK, the two algorithms presented in this paper run in time O(N), where N is the total number of occurrences of literals in A. By representing a Horn proposition as a graph, the satisfiability problem can be formulated as a data flow problem, a certain type of pebbling. The difference between the two algorithms presented here is the strategy used for pebbling the graph. The first algorithm is based on the principle used for finding the set of nonterminals of a context-free grammar from which the empty string can be derived. The second algorithm is a graph traversal and uses a “call-by-need” strategy. This algorithm uses an attribute grammar to translate a propositional Horn formula to its corresponding graph in linear time. Our formulation of the satisfiability problem as a data flow problem appears to be new and suggests the possibility of improving efficiency using parallel processors."

  abstract="This paper presents a detailed empirical study of local search for Boolean satisfiability (SAT), highlighting several interesting properties, some of which were previously unknown or had only anecdotal evidence. Specifically, we study hard random 3-CNF formulas and provide surprisingly simple analytical fits for the optimal (static) noise level and the runtime at optimal noise, as a function of the clause-to-variable ratio. We also demonstrate, for the first time for local search, a power-law decay in the tail of the runtime distribution in the low noise regime. Finally, we discuss a Markov Chain model capturing this intriguing feature.",
