As part of my Computer Science studies at Johannes Kepler University, I implemented a small program in order to experiment with local search algorithms for the Renamable Horn problem. For theoretical background, implementation details and experiments see the file 'Thesis.pdf'. 
The algorithm is implemented in C and all graphs are generated with Rscript and Octave.
